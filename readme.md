<h2> User Instructions </h2>

<p>
when the program begins the user will be shown the recognition screen (not implemented). They can navigate to the "draw tab in order to draw their gestures. On arrival the "Save" button should be disabled, as the user is not allowed to save empty canvas drawings. Upon drawing a single gesture the canvas now becomes savable. A single canvas can hold many gestures, however only the last single gesture will be drawn. </p> 
<br/>
<p>
Upon hitting save a dialog box will appear requesting the user to save the file with a name, again the dialog save button will be disabled until a character is entered in the dialog box, at which point the user can save. Upon saving their gesture the entire canvas is cleared, leaving only the last gesture for display. Any further drawings will be considered a new file while remaining in this tab. </p>
<br/>
<p>
To see their drawings in a list the user can navigate to the library tab, where they will see all of their drawings. Their will be a small canvas on the LHS displaying their drawing, a "edit" button and "delete" button. Clicking the delete button will remove the drawing from list of drawings. Clicking the edit button will take the user to another screen where their drawing will be dislayed, and they can now clear the board and draw a new image as well as rename the file. </p>
<br/>
Upon exiting the application all drawings will be saved and visible on launch
